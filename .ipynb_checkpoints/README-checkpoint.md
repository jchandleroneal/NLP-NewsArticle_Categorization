**Authors**: Chandler O'Neal, Jordan Johnson, Kyle Vosen

## Overview

The focus of this project was to observe a given description from an unknown news article to the created model that would then determine the category of the article.  

---

## Business Problem


---

## Data 

This project used the News Category Dataset from Rishabh Misra which had originally been web scraped from The Huffington Post. The data, post cleaning, contained 2 features with 200,853 records (news articles). 

---


### Content

`Headline`: `Title of the article`.

`Short_description`: `Short description of the article`.

`NOTE`: `Both headline and short description were concatenated prior to the modeling process`.

---

### Predictor Value

`Category`: `The arrticles classification`.
