## Overview

The focus of this project was to create a machine learning model that could receive descriptions of unknown news articles from huffington post and categorize them. The original data observed contained 5 features, the target variable (the category of the article), and 200,853 records (News Articles); these were then reduced to one feature, the concatenated headline and description, the target variable, and 200,853 records.
